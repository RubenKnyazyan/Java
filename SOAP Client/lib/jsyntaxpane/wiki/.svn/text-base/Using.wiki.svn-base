= Introduction =

JSyntaxPane provides you with a very simple way of highlighting your code / snippets in Java Swing.  Here is how to use it.

= Details =

  # Load the latest release.

  # You can build from source, or just take the JSyntaxPane.jar from the dist folder.  Add it to your classpath.

  # JSyntaxPane needs a JEditorPane control.  Just set the control's editorKit property as follows:
{{{
    jEdtTest.setEditorKit(new SyntaxKit("java"));
}}}

The languages currently supported are Java, JavaScript, Groovy and XML.

To change the default colors, modify the SyntaxStyles class.

That's it!
